- Raspberry Pi computer
- Sense HAT

    You'll need to install Mu. Open a Terminal window and type the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install mu-editor
    ```

or:

- PC

If you have a Raspberry Pi but no Sense HAT, you can use the Sense HAT emulator in Raspbian. Simply change the import line at the top of your code from:

`from sense_hat import SenseHat`

to:

`from sense_emu import SenseHat`.

If you don't have a Raspberry Pi, you can use the Trinket Sense HAT emulator online at [trinket.io/sense-hat](https://trinket.io/sense-hat). The import line is the same.
